# Wireless-Labs_Cisco-Packet-Tracer (Using Cisco Packet Tracer)

Welcome to my **Wireless practical lab repository**!  

This project documents my hands-on journey with **Cisco Wireless Devices** in Packet Tracer.  

I've planned for creating a ready to use (clean) .pkt file and fully commented configuration scripts. But for now, each lab contain a image of lab's topology and a fully done .pkt file.

### 🚀 Goal

Improve my **documentation skills** and solidify my **technical knowledge** in wireless networking.

### 📂 Lab Index

| Lab Topic | Brief Description | Status |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| [Basic WLC & AP Management](./Lab_Basic-WLC-and-AP-Management) | Configure basic WLC management IP, admin account, Lightweight AP join process via trunk ports, DHCP integration from Router, create a SSID and test wireless connectivity from end devices. | ✅ Done |
| [Multi-VLANs AP Management with WLC](./Lab_Multi-VLAN_WLC_AP_Management) | Configure multi-VLAN segmentation (VLAN 10/20/30) with WLC dynamic interfaces, Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing, DHCP relay from external DHCP Server, SSID mapping per VLAN (WLAN_10/20/30 with passwords), and verify inter-VLAN connectivity. | ✅ Done |

### 🛠️ Lab Environment

All labs are built and tested in **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 8.x recommended).


### 📝 How to Use These Labs

1. Download the **.pkt** file from the lab folder (or rebuild it yourself if you want the full hands-on experience).
2. Open it in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
3. If the file is fully configured: Use show command to review what I've done.
4. If you prefer to configure from scratch: Follow the step-by-step instructions in the lab folder.


### 📌 Future Plans

- Add more advanced labs 😁


### ⚠️ Disclaimer

Configurations are based on my current knowledge and Packet Tracer's limitations — there might be bugs or simplifications.
